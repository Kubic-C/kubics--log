            <p>
                PMUT or P.M.U.T. is the first big project <br>
                I had ever worked on, and for me it taught <br>
                a lot. The project itself was like a cli <br>
                alternative with my additional commands and <br>
                other things. I had a lot of fun programming <br>
                it and additionally most of what I know of C++ <br>
                comes from it. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                PMUT used opengl with its own in-built console <br>
                with in and out buffers. You could render text by pirority <br>
                and make your own commands and use them through PMUT. <br>
                PMUT had a lot put it into it which when making big projects <br>
                made it hard to work on it and find bugs. It also made me <br>
                realize that classes are probably not the best for <br>
                building most of an appilcation. <br>
            </p> 

            <p>
                And if you're wondering what PMUT stands for it is: <br>
                Porter Multi Use Terminal. <br>

            <p>
                PMUT-CMAKE is "crossplatform" version of PMUT. <br>
                PMUT-CMAKE was the first project I had made <br>
                on a linux-distro specifically Ubuntu. PMUT-CMAKE <br>
                in my opinion was a MUCH cleaner version the <br>
                original PMUT. And the reason it is called <br>
                PMUT-CMAKE if it you did not get it from the <br>
                name is becuase it was made with CMAKE <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                PMUT-CMAKE taught me how to use CMAKE, <br>
                the CLI, among a few other things that <br>
                you can only learn from using a linux-distro. <br>
                PMUT-CMAKE had all if not more features <br>
                then the original PMUT.

            <h1>Project <a target="_blank" class="expand-ref" href="https://github.com/Kubic-C/dino-game">(dino-game):</a> </h1>

            <p>
                dino-game was a fun little game that <br>
                I made in a day or two. Pretty much a <br>
                C++ console version of the offline <br>
                dino-game from google-chrome <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                What I learned from it was: <br>
                how to use the confusing windows <br>
                console API. :P <br>
            </p>

            <h1>Project <a target="_blank" class="expand-ref" href="https://github.com/Kubic-C/kubics-console">(kubics-console):</a> </h1>

            <p>
                kubics-console takes the console from <br>
                PMUT and allows you to use it. I have <br>
                not learned much from the project. So <br>
                I will go over what it can do and what <br>
                it will do. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                kubics-console is a cross-platform library. <br>
                That allows you to directly write and read <br>
                to its output buffer and input buffer. You <br>
                can port console games to it to allow them <br>
                to be cross platform. You can use this instead <br>
                of your OS' native console. If you want to <br>
                use more then just std::cout to maniuplate your <br>
                console, I would suggest kubics-console. <br>

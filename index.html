               <p>
                     Hello I am am Kubic(also known as Sawya), </br>
                     and I program(duh). I like to work with   </br>
                     graphics APIs, and make games with them. </br>
                     I also know a little bit about the front-end </br>
                     development side of  things as well, but I am </br>
                     not too instrested in it. </br>
               </p>
               <p>                   
                     My (current) primary programming langauge </br>
                     is C++, I only really use it because people </br>
                     have developed a lot of good libraries with it. </br>
                     (it also has nice standard library.) </br>
               <p>
                     My current goal is to make big (ass) space game </br>
                     that people can explore with other players and fly </br>
                     around the galaxy with their ships </br>
               </p>
               <p>
                     I have programming for about 2 years. </br>
                     I am always up for learning new things and </br>
                     belive in doing so you may live more comfortably. </br>

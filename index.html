                <p>
                   Hello i am Kubic, I like to make things. <br>
                   I generally like to develop things that <br>
                   can have a potential to help people, and other <br>
                   programmers. If a project I am working on does <br>
                   neither, I don't work on them for long. But <br>
                   that only goes for big projects. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                   I know a couple of langauges well and some <br>
                   others only slightly. I know programming <br>
                   langauges such as: some x86 asm, c++, some c, <br>
                   python, some ruby, some haskell, and finally js<br>
                   I am not going to include css and html since I <br>
                   would not consider those really programming <br>
                   languages <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                   I am not really too good when it comes to thinking<br>
                   of projects to make, but when I do start one I<br>
                   devote most of my brain power and time on it.<br>
                   I am always up to helping other programmers on<br>
                   their projects. As long as it falls into my scope<br>
                   of knowlege, but I am not against learning to help.<br>
